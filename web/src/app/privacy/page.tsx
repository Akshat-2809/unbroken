          Unbroken is based in {LEGAL_LOCATION}. We are building an AI-native enterprise platform for the logistics and supply
          chain industry, and we are currently in stealth.

        <p>
          This policy covers this website: visiting it and emailing us. For the data described here, we decide why
          and how it is used, so under Indian law we are the <b>Data Fiduciary</b> and you are the <b>Data Principal</b>. We
          follow the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the SPDI Rules, 2011, and we are aligning with the Digital Personal
          Data Protection Act, 2023 and its Rules of 2025 (the &ldquo;DPDP law&rdquo;) as they come into force.
